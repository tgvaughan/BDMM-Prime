* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-1-Introduction
:END:

BDMM-Prime is a BEAST 2 package for performing phylodynamic inference
under a variety of linear birth-death-sampling models with/without
types.

** Comparison with BDMM
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Introduction-Comparison-with-BDMM
:END:

The BDMM-Prime project is a hard fork of the original [[https://github.com/denisekuehnert/bdmm][BDMM project]].
The intention is to extend the functionality of the original package,
while improving its flexibility and ease of use.  It incorporates the
following enhancements:
- an improved BEAUti interface that allows a much more diverse range of analyses to be configured,
- automatic fall-back to analytical solutions for unstructured (single type) analyses,
- use of stochastic mapping for sampling ancestral states,
- a particle filtering algorithm allowing joint sampling of population trajectories,
- a heavily refactored code base intended to make the package easier to use,
  extend and maintain.

As a result of the many changes that were required in making this transition,
BDMM-Prime is completely incompatible with BDMM itself.  Thus the original
package will be maintained separately to ensure that BEAST 2 XMLs and packages
that depend on it remain usable.

* Getting Started
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-1-Getting-Started
:END:


** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Getting-Started-Installation
:END:

BDMM-Prime requires a working installation of [[https://www.beast2.org][BEAST 2.7]] which can be obtained from
https://www.beast2.org/. The package itself can then be installed via the
built-in package manager in the following way:

1. Open BEAUti.
2. From the =File= menu select =Manage Packages=.
3. Click the =Package repositories= button at the bottom of the dialog box.
4. Click =Add URL= and enter the following repository URL:\\
    https://tgvaughan.github.io/BDMM-Prime/package.xml.\\
    The list of repositories should now look like this:
    [[./figures/package_repo.png]]
5. Close the repository manager.
6. The latest version of BDMM-Prime should now appear in the list of packages:
   [[./figures/package_manager.png]]
   Select it, then click the =Install/Upgrade= button.
7. Close the package manager.

BDMM-Prime should now be available to use on your system. (You will need to
restart BEAUti before you can set up any analyses.)

Aside: Eventually BDMM-Prime will be available from the default BEAST 2
repository.  However, while it is still in development, it must be
installed from the above repository.

** Setting up your first analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Getting-Started-Setting-up-your-first-analysis
:END:

Here we will step through the process of setting up, running and
interpreting a simple BDMM-Prime analysis.  For the purpose of
demonstration, we will focus on applying a multi-type model to simple
two-type epidemiological data set, but the same general approach can
be taken to set up single-type analyses of other data sets too.

BDMM-Prime analyses can be set up in BEAUti in much the same way that
analyses under using other BEAST 2 models such as BDSKY or the
Bayesian Skyline Plot can be set up. The only part unique to
BDMM-Prime is "tree prior" configuration.  Nonetheless, below we
describe the /complete/ process of setting up a small BDMM-Prime
analysis.

/The following should be read like a short tutorial. Steps
to perform on your computer are highlighted like this:/
#+begin_quote
Start BEAUti.
#+end_quote

*Note:* the following assumes some limited familiarity with BEAST 2.
If you've never used this software before, please consider working
through the [[https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-BEAST2/][Introduction to BEAST 2 tutorial]].

*** Loading sequence data into BEAUti
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Loading-sequence-data-into-BEAUti
:END:

For this tutorial, we'll be using the example influenza data which is
installed along with BDMM-Prime. This data, assembled from
publicly-available data downloaded from NCBI GenBank, is the same set
used in [[https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Structured-coalescent][this MultiTypeTree tutorial]]. It consists of an aligned set of
60 H3N2 HA sequences sampled from New Zealand and Hong Kong. To make
finding this data easy, we first select the package working directory.
#+begin_quote
Select "Set working dir" from the File menu, then choose "BDMM-Prime" from the sub-menu.
#+end_quote

To load the data, simply choose "Import alignment" from the File menu
and select one or more FASTA files.

#+begin_quote
Select "Import alignment" from the File menu to display a file
selection dialog box.  Using this, open the ~examples~ subdirectory
and select the file ~h3n2_2deme.fna~.
#+end_quote

The BEAUti window should now look something like the following:
[[./figures/tutorial_seqloaded.png]]

*** Setting up tip dates
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Setting-up-tip-dates
:END:

The sequences in this data set are sampled at different times, so use
the following instructions to import this information into the analysis.
(This step is unnecessary if sequences were collected at the same time,
or near enough given the anticipated scale of the tree.)

#+begin_quote
Select the Tip Dates panel and check the "Use tip dates" option. Then
press the "Auto-configure" button to set the times based on values
extracted from the sequence headers. Finally, use the radio button
and dropdown menu to interpret everything after the last "~_~"
character as a numerical tip time.
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_tipdates.png]]

*** Setting the site model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Setting-the-site-model
:END:

For this example, we will use the basic [[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02101694][HKY]] substitution model, with
equilibrium nucleotide frequencies fixed to the empirical frequencies
of characters in our alignment.  

#+begin_quote
Select the "Site model" panel. Select the HKY model with "empirical" nucleotide frequencies.
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_sitemodel.png]]

This choice to fix the equilibrium frequencies is made here only
to reduce the computational complexity of the tutorial analysis.
For production analyses, these should probably be estimated, and
Gamma-distributed site-to-site rate heterogeneity should also be used.

*** Setting the clock model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Setting-the-clock-model
:END:

Since we have serially-sampled data, our analysis requires some kind
of molecular clock.  For the sake of simplicity, we use a strict
clock, setting the initial value of the clock rate to $5\times 10^{-3}$
substitutions per site per year, which is close to the true
value for influenza.

#+begin_quote
Select the "Cock model" panel. Set the "mean clock rate" value to 0.005.
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_clock.png]]

*** Selecting the tree prior
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Selecting-the-tree-prior
:END:

The tree prior (also known as the phylodynamic likelihood) is the
component of the analysis which BDMM-Prime provides. Here we configure
the particular birth-death model we will use to relate the tree to
the various population-level parameters we'd like to learn about.
#+begin_quote
Select the "Priors" panel.  To choose the BDMM-Prime tree prior, find
the drop-down menu next to ~Tree.t:h3n2_2deme~ and select "BDMMPrime".
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_treeprior.png]]

*** Setting up the sample types
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Setting-up-the-sample-types
:END:

The next thing we want to do is to specify the locations associated with each of the
samples included in our analysis.
#+begin_quote
Scroll down to end of the tree prior section and find the table associating tree leaves
with locations. Notice that the sample names have the form =ID_Location_Date=. To
extract the locations from the sample names, click the ~Auto-configure~ button,
select ~split on character~, ensure "~_~" is specified as the delimiter, and select
"2" from the ~take group(s)~ drop-down menu.  Once this is complete, press "Ok".
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_tiptypes.png]]

The table should now be populated with types extracted from the sample names.

[[./figures/tutorial_tiptypes2.png]]

*** Configuring the multi-type model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Configuring-the-multi-type-model
:END:

Now we get to the main part of the analysis setup, where we decide exactly how
to model the generation of our data. In our case, we want to model a small part
of the global transmission dynamics of H3N2.

The first thing to do is to is to select our desired parameterization
of the birth-death model. In our case, as we're analysing pathogen
sequences in an attempt to reconstruct transmission dynamics, we'll
use the epidemiological parameterization.
#+begin_quote
Expand the tree prior section by clicking the arrow next to ~Tree.t:h3n2~ on the
left-hand side of of the screen.  Then select "Epi Parameterization" from the
drop-down menu at the top of the expanded section.
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_parameterization.png]]

With this done, the next task is to define the dimensionality and
initial values of the multi-type birth-death parameters. In BDMM-Prime,
each of these parameters is considered a "skyline parameter" which can
change in a piecewise-constant fashion through time.

The first skyline parameter to consider is the Re parameter, representing
the effective reproductive number.  By default parameter values are
assumed to be the same across all types,

#+begin_quote
For the Re skyline parameter, uncheck the "Scalar values" check box to
allow this parameter to take type-dependent values.
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_ReSetup.png]]

The next parameter is the "become uninfectious rate" parameter, representing
the rate at which infected individuals become uninfectious. As this parameter
is predominantly a function of the pathogen rather than location, we will
assume it takes a single value which  is shared among types. Furthermore,
as influenza infections often take a relatively short time to pass, we will initialise
this value to correspond to an infectious period of 1 week.

#+begin_quote
Find the Become Uninfectious Rate parameter, double-click the starting value and
change it to 52 (per year).  *Be sure to press "Enter" to cause BEAUti to accept
the new value.*
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_BUSetup.png]]

Now let's consider the Sampling Proportion parameter. This parameter requires
special care, as the sampling assumptions of the model can dramatically influence
inference results.  In our case we want (a) to allow for type-dependent sampling proportions
and (b) to fix the sampling proportion to zero for all times earlier than the first
sample.

In BDMM-Prime, this configuration is reasonably simple to configure.
#+begin_quote
Find the Sampling Proportion parameter, then follow these steps:
1. Uncheck the "Scalar value" checkbox to allow for type-dependent values.
2. Check "Display visualization" to see the distribution of sample times relative
   to the most recent sample.
3. Set the "Number of change times" value to 1.  (Notice the appearance of the epoch
   boundary marker on the visualisation.)
4. Set the change time for the boundary between epoch 1 and 2 to 5.7. (Notice that this
   value ensures the oldest sample remains in epoch 1.)
5. In the "Values" table, double-click the entries corresponding to
   the sampling proportion values for Epoch 2 and change each to 0.0,
   remembering to press "enter" after each change.
#+end_quote

Note *skyline parameter values of 0 are always fixed* in the analysis, regardless of
whether or not the "estimate values" option is checked.

[[./figures/tutorial_SampSetup.png]]

Finally, we need to define how lineages change type in our multi-type
model.  Like BDMM, BDMM-Prime allows both direct "migration" as well
as "birth to a new type" styles of multi-type models.  Given we are
modelling the movement of infected influenza hosts, migration suits
our situation best.  We also acknowledge that migration rates between
different pairs of types/locations may be different from one another.

To incorporate these decisions, follow these instructions:
#+begin_quote
Find the Migration Rate parameter, then:
1. Double-click on the value and change it from it's default to the smaller
   rate of 0.1 (any infected individual has a 10% chance of moving between
   the two locations in any given year).
2. Uncheck the "Scalar values" checkbox to allow rates to vary between pairs of
   locations.
3. Check the "Estimate values" checkbox to ensure these migration
   rates are estimated.
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_migSetup.png]]

*** Setting the remaining parameter priors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-Setting-the-remaining-parameter-priors
:END:

With the multi-type model is configured, what remains is to define priors for
each of the parameters we're estimating.  As in any ther BEAST analysis, this
includes parameters each of the various site, clock and phylodynamic models we've
configured.

Rather than describe in detail how to set these priors, here we will simply list
a set of simple priors which can be used for the purpose of demonstrating the
model. (Detailed information on setting up priors in BEAUti can be found elsewhere, see
for instance the [[https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/Prior-selection/][Prior Selection tutorial]] on the Taming the BEAST website.

#+begin_quote
Set the following parameter priors:
|------------------------------------------+------------------|
| Parameter                                | Prior            |
|------------------------------------------+------------------|
| =ReEpi.t:h3n2_2deme=                     | LogNormal(0,0.5) |
| =becomeUninfectiousRateEpi.t:h3n2_2deme= | 1/X              |
| =migrationRateEpi.t:h3n2_2deme=          | Exp(0.1)         |
| =samplingProportionEpi.t:h3n2_2deme=     | Unif(0,1)        |
|------------------------------------------+------------------|
#+end_quote

*** MCMC and Logging setup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Setting-up-your-first-analysis-Getting-Started-MCMC-and-Logging-setup
:END:

Finally, we need to configure the details of the MCMC chain to run and the trees and
parameters to be logged.

#+begin_quote
Switch to the MCMC panel and change the Chain Length to 1000000 ($10^6$).
#+end_quote

[[./figures/tutorial_MCMC.png]]

For this demonstration we will leave everything else as-is. Notice however that
beyond the regular trace, screen and tree logs, there are three additional loggers.
We'll discuss these in more detail 

- typedTreeLogger :: A logger which uses stochastic mapping to
  generate samples from the marginal posterior over edge-typed trees,
  which amount to hypotheses about when and where each type change
  occurred on the tree.
  
- nodeTypedTreeLogger :: Similar to typedTreeLogger, but the sampled trees
  includes type information only at internal nodes.  Used to build summary trees
  with BEAST 2's TreeAnnotator utility.

- trajLogger :: A logger which uses particle filtering to log samples
  from the marginal posterior of multi-type population trajectories.
  
Each of these loggers is optional, and can be enabled/disabled by
clicking the arrow buttons to their left and checking/unchecking the
"Enable logger" box.  By default edge-typed tree logging is enabled,
but trajectory logging is disabled.

** Saving and Running the analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Getting-Started-Saving-and-Running-the-analysis
:END:

Now we can save and run the analysis:
#+begin_quote
1. Open the "File" menu and select "Save". Choose a sensible location
   in your filesystem in which to save the analysis file, which should
   be named =h3n2.xml=.  (By default the location will be the
   examples/ folder from which you loaded the sequences: you'll want
   to choose somewhere else, perhaps a folder on your desktop.)
2. Launch BEAST, select the =h3n2.xml= as the input file, then run the analysis.
#+end_quote

** Processing the results
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Getting-Started-Processing-the-results
:END:

Once the analysis is complete, we can have a look at the results.  (If
you're impatient, note that BEAST 2 regularly appends to output files
and that these files can also be studied in the following way while
BEAST is still running.)  The output files which should have been produced are

- =h3n2.log= :: The parameter log file,
- =h3n2-h3n2_2deme.trees= :: A tree log file with no types marked,
- =h3n2.h3n2_2deme.typed.trees= :: A tree log file with all ancestral types and type changes marked,
- =h3n2.h3n2_2deme.typed.node.trees= :: A tree log  file with only types at ancestral nodes marked.


*** The parameter log file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Processing-the-results-Getting-Started-The-parameter-log-file
:END:

Firstly, let's open the parameter log file using the Tracer app (distributed with BEAST 2).

#+begin_quote
Open Tracer, select "Import trace file..." from the File menu.  Use the interface
to explore the marginal distributions as estimated from the MCMC samples.
#+end_quote

We see immediately that the ESS for many of the parameters is low,
which is unsurprising for such a short run.  However, the focus here is on
understanding how BDMM-Prime analysis results are presented in the log file rather
than trying to seriously interpret the results.

With this in mind, see firstly that each of the estimated parameters including ~Re~,
~becomeUninfectiousRate~ and ~migrationRate~ are represented in the log file
by =ReSPEpi=, =becomeUninfectiousRateSPEpi= and =migrationRateSPEpi=.  The "SP"
indicates that the parameter is a "Skyline parameter" (as opposed to BEAST 2's
regular ~RealParameter~).

Also notice that when we have allowed type-specific (not scalar) values, as
in the case of ~Re~, the parameter name appears multiple times with a suffix
indicating the type associated with the specific value.

Finally, notice that when we have allowed the parameter to change at a particular
time, each epoch/interval receives its own set of parameter values. In this case
an additional ".endtime" value is also recorded, which identifies the end time
of a specific interval, measured relative to the start time of the process.

[[./analyses/tracer.png]]

*** The tree log files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Processing-the-results-Getting-Started-The-tree-log-files
:END:

The untyped tree log file can be dealt with in the same way as all BEAST 2 tree files.
However we also have tree log files containing sampled ancestral type information
which we can use to learn about the type change process as it occurred on the tree.
In this influenza case, this contains potentially interesting information about
global influenza spatial dynamics.

While in principle the .typed.trees file contains the most detailed information,
it is easier to jointly summarize these ancestral dynamics with the tree itself
by applying the TreeAnnotator program to the =.typed.node.trees= file.

#+begin_quote
1. Open TreeAnnotator (distributed with BEAST 2)
2. For the node heights option, select "mean heights". (This produces
   less biased estimates of divergence times than the default.)
3. Select =h3n2.h3n2_2deme.typed.node.trees= as the input file.
4. Choose an appropriate output file name (e.g. =summary.tree=)
5. Click "Run".
#+end_quote

[[./analyses/treeannotator.png]]

Once complete, you can visualise the summary tree using any
BEAST-compatible tree viewer, such as FigTree or IcyTree.
#+begin_quote
1. Navigate to https://icytree.org in a javascript-enabled web browser.
2. Select "Load from file" from the File menu and select the =summary.tree= file
   produced by TreeAnnotator.
3. From the Style menu choose "colour nodes by" and then "type".
3. Also from the Style menu choose "Node height error bars" and then "=height_95%_HPD=".
#+end_quote

This should produce something quite like the figure below:

[[./analyses/summary_tree.png]]

Notice that we've chosen to colour the nodes themselves rather than the edges.
This is done precisely because in the case of these node-typed symmary trees,
it is only the types at the nodes that are being represented.  Please resist
the urge to colour the edges based on these values!  While tree viewers make this
easy, and it is frequently done, it is a misleading representation.

* Model specification using BEAUti
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-1-Model-specification-using-BEAUti
:END:

In the following section we'll delve into the BDMM-Prime interface in
more detail.  Unlike the tutorial, this section is written in a more
general way rather than considering a specific data set. However, we
will occasionally refer to the example in the tutorial, so it would be
helpful if you'd worked through that first before proceeding to the
sections below.

** The BDMM-Prime Tree Prior
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-The-BDMM-Prime-Tree-Prior
:END:

Using BDMM-Prime amounts to selecting the BDMM-Prime tree prior when
choosing priors for a particular analysis. This is a very flexible
tree prior, encompassing a wide variety of single- and multi-type
birth-death-sampling models, allowing for fixed-rate and
time-dependent-rate analyses.

For earlier packages such as BDSKY and BDMM, the inputs to the relevant tree priors
were organised in very flat manner, with the tree prior directly taking
inputs for birth and death rates, change times, including similar values for
alternative parameterisations.

In contrast, inputs to the BDMM-Prime tree prior are organised in a
hierarchical way which seeks to avoid repetition and improve
flexibility.  At the top level, the BDMM-Prime tree prior takes 
the following five main elements:
1. The tree,
2. tip type information,
3. starting type prior probabilities, and
4. a "parameterization" object defining how the model is to be parameterized.

The tree itself is automatically defined and provided to the tree prior by BEAUti.
It therefore remains only to define the remaining three, which are detailed in the
following sections.

** Defining Tip Types
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Defining-Tip-Types
:END:

A "Type Trait Set" is used to associate types with each of the leaf nodes of the
tree (i.e. each of the samples in the sequence alignment).
It is completely analogous to the trait sets used associate times with
leaf nodes.

To set the tip types, open the Priors panel and ensure the BDMM-Prime tree prior 
is expanded by clicking the arrow button on the left-hand side of the window.
The relevant input editor is labeled "Type Trait Set" and can be found by scrolling down 
past the "Parameterization" section.

The input editor functions very similarly to the tip dates input editor.  All tips
are initially given the same type, =UNSPECIFIED=. (There is nothing
special about this value, only that it is shared among all tips, causing the model
to include only one type.) Individual can be specified using any string, although
problems may occur if strings contain spaces or other whitespace characters.

To set the types, one can double-click on a specific value in the type
column and enter a new value. This approach quickly becomes tedious,
however, so I highly recommend that you instead click the
=Auto-configure= button.  This presents a dialog box which allows you
to assign types by either extracting type values from a portion of the
taxon/sequence name, or by loading them in from an external file. (The
required format of this file is described in the built-in help which
can be accessed by pressing the button labeled =?=.)

** Start type prior probabilities
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Start-type-prior-probabilities
:END:

Start type prior probabilities are a little-discussed yet crucial
aspect of multi-type birth-death model specification.  For a model
with $M$ demes, the start type prior probabilities are $M$ positive
numbers which sum to 1 and represent the (categorical) prior
distribution over the possible types associated with the original
individual in the multi-type birth-death process.

To set these prior probabilities, find the relevant input editor within
the tree prior input editor. (It is usually located between the Parameterization
and Type Trait Set input sections.) For a model with two types, it appears as
follows in its initial configuration:
[[./figures/startTypePriorProbs.png]]
Probabilities are entered as numerical values with spaces between
them.  The number of values must match the number of demes in your
model.  The $i^{\text{th}}$ number is the prior probability for the
$i^{\text{th}}$ type when the types are sorted in lexicographical
(generalized alphabetical) order.

By default the prior probabilities are chosen to be uniform.  In many
cases this is a sensible choice, however it may be the case that you
are certain that the birth-death process began (or did /not/ begin) in
some particular state.  For instance, you might know - or be willing
to assume - that an outbreak was seeded by travel cases other
locations.  In such cases you can modify the probability values to reflect
these prior assumptions.

It is also possible to "estimate" these prior probabilities. Clicking
the estimate button causes BEAUti to assign a flat Dirichlet
"hyper-prior" to the probabilities (i.e. a uniform distribution
subject only to the constraint that the probabilities must be positive
and sum to 1). We advise against doing this, as doing so is
completely equivalent to simply setting a uniform prior in the first
place.

** Parameterizations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Parameterizations
:END:

BDMM-Prime provides a simple plug-in mechanism for handling different
parameterizations.  With only one minor exception for the FBD parameterization
(described below), all of these parameterizations provides perfectly equivalent
specifications of the birth-death model.

Given this equivalence, one might wonder why multiple parameterizations
are necessary at all. There are two main reasons these are important:
1. Context-specific parameterizations allow for easier interpretation of inference results, and
2. they allow appropriate field-specific prior information to be included.

This second point is arguably the most important as, for instance, a
paleontologist might conceivably have prior information on past speciation or diversification
rates, while epidemiologists might be able to more confidently put bounds on $R_e$.

Thus it is often a good idea to select the parameterization which
best reflects your biological context.

The following sections briefly describe the currently-available parameterizations 
and their relationships to one another.

*** Canonical
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Parameterizations-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Canonical
:END:

The "canonical" parameterization is in a sense the native mathematical
description of the birth-death model; the its parameters reflect the rates of
the basic reactions which make up the process.

- Birth Rate ($\lambda_{ii}$) :: This is the (per individual per unit time) rate at which
  each individual in the population $i$ produce new individuals of their own type.
- Death Rate ($\mu_i$) :: Similarly, this is the rate at which individuals in population $i$
  are removed from the population. 
- Sampling Rate ($\psi_i$) :: This is the rate at which individuals in population $i$ are "sampled". A non-zero
  rate here corresponds to a process that will produce samples that are distributed
  through time. (Sometimes referred to as $\psi$-sampling.)
- Removal probability ($r_i$) :: This is the probability with which sampled individuals
  in population $i$ are also removed from the population.
- Rho sampling ($\rho_i$) :: This parameterizes binomial sampling at a
  particular time (usually the present). If enabled, each individual in 
  population $i$ is considered in turn, and sampled with this probability.

In addition, the following rates parameterize reactions which allow type changes
to occur.  In general these are specified as matrices, allowing for a unique
rate for every ordered pair of distinct types.
- Migration Rate ($m_{ij}$) :: 
  This is the rate at which an individual with some type /becomes/
  an individual of another type.
- Birth Among Demes ($\lambda_{ij}$) ::
  This is the rate at which an individual with some type /produces/
  an individual of another type.

Finally, the following parameter expresses the total duration of the birth-death-sampling
process. 
- ProcessLength :: the time between the start of the process and the most recent sample.
  (Here equivalent to the "origin" of the process.)

*** Epidemiological
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Parameterizations-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Epidemiological
:END:

The assumption behind the "epidemiological" parameterization is that
individuals in the model represent infected individuals in a
population. In place of the canonical birth, death and sampling
parameters we have

- Re ($R_{ii}$) :: This is the type-specific effective reproductive number,
  defined by $R_i=\lambda_{ii}/(\mu_i+r_i\psi_i)$.  Values above 1
  correspond to growing (in expectation) numbers of infected
  individuals.
- Become uninfectious rate ($\delta_i$) :: This is the rate at which infected individuals
  are removed from the infectious pool, either with or without sampling.
  In terms of the canonical parameters, this is $\mu_i+r_i\psi_i$.
- Sampling proportion ($s_i$) :: This is the probability with which infected individuals
  are sampled through time, defined as $\psi_i/(\mu_i+r_i\psi_i)$.

Besides the migration matrix, epidemiological compartment changes are parameterized by:
- Re Among Demes ($R_{ij}$) :: This is a generalisation of the effective reproductive number
  to account for transmissions between epidemiological compartments. It is defined
  as $R_{ij}=\lambda_{ij}/(\mu_i+r_i\psi_i)$.

(The rho sampling, removal probability, migration and process
length parameters are identical to those described for the canonical
parameterization.)

*** Fossilized birth-death process
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Parameterizations-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Fossilized-birth-death-process
:END:

The FBD parameterization is most appropriate when individuals in the
model are intended to represent whole species, and birth and death
events correspond to speciation and extinction.  In place of the
canonical birth, death and sampling rate parameters we have

- Diversification ($d_{ii}=\lambda_{ii}-\mu_i$) :: This is the rate at
  which species richness increases through time.
- Turnover ($t_{i}=\mu_i/\lambda_{ii}$) :: For $d_{ii}>0$, this
  parameter indicates the relative frequency with which species go extinct before
  speciation, and satisfies $0\leq t_i < 1$.
- Sampling proportion ($s_i=\psi_i/(\mu_i+r_i\psi_i)$) :: Analogous to
  the epdemiological parameterization, this indicates the probability
  with which species leave fossils before going extinct.

Besides the migration rate, species type changes are parameterized by:
- Diversification between types ($d_{ij}=\lambda_{ij}-\mu_i$) :: This
  is a generalisation of diversification rate, but allowing for one of the daughter
  species to carry a new type.

(The rho sampling, removal probability, migration and process
length parameters are identical to those described for the canonical
parameterization.)

*Note*: Unlike the Canonical and Epidemiological parameterizations,
the FBD parameterization on its own does not permit exploration of the
whole parameter space.  In particular, it makes the assumption that
diversification is always increasing ($d_{ii}>0$ and $t_{i}<1$).  If
you want to also allow negative diversification, use the Canonical
parameterization instead.

** Skyline Parameters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Skyline-Parameters
:END:

Besides Parameterizations, an importance difference between BDMM-Prime
and earlier packages like BDMM and BDSKY is the use of special-purpose
"Skyline parameters" to describe piecewise-constant variation in rates
and other parameters. Each piecewise-constant function must be
specified using a combination of "change times" and "epoch values",
the latter determining the value of the function should take in each
"epoch" between the change times. 

The relationship between epochs, change times and epoch values is
illustrated in the following schematic:

[[./figures/epochsAndChangeTimes.png]]

Each skyline parameter has its own set of change times, which can be
specified as times relative to the start of the process or ages
relative to the most recent sample in the tree. These times or ages
can be specified as absolute values or as fractions of the total
process length.  Keeping these decisions close to the parameter they
affect and independent of those affecting other parameters provides
maximum flexibility and minimal confusion.  The BDMM-Prime BEAUti
interface provides each of these options for every relevant rate and
probability parameter.

Skyline parameters come in two main variants: Vector and Matrix
skyline parameters.  These differ only in that they are applied to
vector-valued and matrix-valued parameters, respectively.

*** Overview of the skyline parameter input editor
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Skyline-Parameters-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Overview-of-the-skyline-parameter-input-editor
:END:

In this section we delve into the details of the BDMM-Prime
skyline parameter user interface.  Although focus here on vector skyline
parameters, everything here is also applicable to vector skyline parameters.

The input editor BDMM-Prime uses for specifying skyline parameters is quite
complex, reflecting the large number of ways in which these parameters
can be configured.  The general layout is as follows:

[[./figures/skylineLayout.png]]

Here you can see that the configuration editor consists of three main parts:
the epoch configuration, the value configuration and an epoch visualiser
for helping with the configuration. The following sections detail each
of these parts in turn.

**** Epoch configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-4-Overview-of-the-skyline-parameter-input-editor-Skyline-Parameters-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Epoch-configuration
:END:

The epoch configuration portion of the input editor is responsible for
defining the number of times a skyline parameter will change, and the
times at which these changes will happen.

The "Number of change times" input specifies how many changes will take place.
By default this is 0, indicating that the parameter will take a constant value
at all times.  In this case, none of the user interface elements for
defining the change times are displayed.  To see those, you need to specify
at least 1 change time.

If this condition is satisfied, other elements are displayed. The
first of these requests the (initial) values of the change times.  By
default these represent the "ages" of the change points prior to the
most recent sample. Alternatively, by unchecking the "Times specified
as ages" checkbox, the numbers are interpreted as times (increasing
into the future) relative to the starting point of the process.  In
any case, the values must increase left to right: when specified as an
"age", the first change time represents the most recent change time
looking into the past. Otherwise, the first change time represents the
oldest change time looking from the start of the process into the
future.

By default, the change times are not estimated: they retain their chosen
values through the whole analysis. If you choose, however, you can check
the "Estimate change times" checkbox to tell BEAST to update these change
times during the MCMC.  (Remember to configure a prior for the change times
if you do this!)

Finally, by checking the "Relative to process length" checkbox, one
can cause the change times/ages to be interpreted as fractions of the
process duration.  (I.e. the time between the start of the process and
the most recent genetic sample.)  In this case, the numeric values
provided for the change times must fall between 0 and 1. Note that the
value of the "Times specified as ages" checkbox still determines
whether these values increase into the past (default) or into the
future.  Clicking the "Distribute evenly" button causes these relative
times or ages to be distributed evenly between 0 and 1.

**** Value configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-4-Overview-of-the-skyline-parameter-input-editor-Skyline-Parameters-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Value-configuration
:END:

The initial parameter values corresponding to each epoch are configured
using an input table.  By default, the "Scalar values" option is checked,
causing these values are applied to individuals of all types even when
multiple types exist in the dataset.  If you're performing a multi-type
analysis and want different types to have their own value of a given parameter,
uncheck this option.

*Beware:* When entering values using this table, always remember to
press "Enter" (or "Return") after entering the value in order for
BEAUti to make the requested modificiation.

When estimating values, the "Link identical values" option causes BDMM-Prime to
consider identical values as representing the same degree of freedom. With
this enabled, any set of values which are initially identical will continue
to be identical throughout the analysis.  This option is useful for setting
up multi-type skyline analyses in which some of the type-specific
values extend across epoch boundaries.

**** Epoch visualisation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-4-Overview-of-the-skyline-parameter-input-editor-Skyline-Parameters-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Epoch-visualisation
:END:

The option "Display epoch visualisation" is useful when analysing
samples distributed through time, as enabling it displays a graphical
depiction of the sample distribution alongside the specified epochs
and change times. Sample times are depicted using red and orange
circles, with the coloration changing between every pair of epochs,
allowing one to determine at a glance which epoch a given sample is
currently assigned to.

This visualisation is particularly helpful when setting up sampling
rate or proportion change times, which are often chosen based on the
time of the oldest sample.  (For instance, in the tutorial we configured
the sampling rate of H3N2 such that it was set to zero prior to the
oldest sample included in the analysis.)

** Miscellaneous inputs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Model-specification-using-BEAUti-Miscellaneous-inputs
:END:

Besides the main settings for the model described above, there are several
minor options and settings that can also be configured.  Here they are
in their default configuration:

[[./figures/miscParams.png]]

Below we describe each of them in turn.

- Condition on Survival :: This is a modelling option which, when
  enabled, causes the tree prior to include a term which conditions
  the tree probability on having at least one sampled individual in
  the dataset.

- Use Analytical Single Type Solution :: When there is only a single
  type in the dataset, this option tells BDMM-Prime to
  use analytical (BDSKY) expressions for computing the tree probability
  rather than to rely on numerical integration. For multi-type analyses
  this option has no effect.  (Unless you are testing the numerical
  integration code, there is really no reason to ever disable this option.)

- Rel Tolerance and Abs Tolerance :: These parameters determine the tolerance
  thresholds given to the numerical integration algorithm used to compute
  the tree probability when multiple types are in play.  You should usually
  leave these as-is.
  
- Parallelize :: This option determines whether or not BDMM-Prime will
  use multiple execution threads in an attempt to speed up the tree prior
  calculation on computers with multiple CPU cores available.
  
- Parallelization Factor :: When parallelization is enabled, this
  determines the fraction of all of the tree nodes a subtree must
  contain for its tree prior calculation to be assigned to a different
  thread. The default value of 0.1 should be fine in most cases.

* Sampling Latent Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-1-Sampling-Latent-Variables
:END:

One important distinguishing feature of BDMM-Prime over the earlier
BDMM package is its ability to produce samples of ancestral lineage
types and multi-type population trajectories from the joint posterior
distribution, even though these variables are not sampled using the
MCMC algorithm.  Instead, BDMM-Prime employs stochastic mapping and
particle filtering to sample these latent variables during the logging
procedure.  By applying these algorithms to only a small subset of
the states visited by the MCMC algorithm, we obtain these latent
variable samples for almost no computational cost at all.

In BEAUti, both of these algorithms are configured in the MCMC
pane (where the chain length and loggers are configured).

** Tree edge types and type transitions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Sampling-Latent-Variables-Tree-edge-types-and-type-transitions
:END:

Tree edge types and type transitions are sampled using a stochastic
mapping algorithm based on the work of [[https://doi.org/10.1101/555805][Höhna et al., 2019]].  The stochastic
mapping procedure and the corresponding logging of edge-typed trees is
enabled by default.  To enable/disable stochastic mapping, simply
expand the =typedTreeLogger= and =nodeTypedTreeLogger= input editors
check/uncheck the "Enable Logger" checkbox.

[[./figures/mappingEnable.png]]

These input editors can also be used to adjust important inputs such
as the name of the output files and the number of MCMC steps between
each call to the mapping algorithm.

When enabled, these loggers produce two additional tree log files
beyond the standard untyped tree log file produced by BEAST:
1. a log file with the extension ".typed.trees" containing fully
   edge-typed trees, and
2. a log file with the extension ".typed.node.trees" containing trees
   annotated only with the types at their internal nodes.

These files are equivalent to those produced by packages such as
MultiTypeTree and BDMM. Both of these files can be examined using tree
viewers such as FigTree or IcyTree, however only the typed node tree
file can be summarized using TreeAnnotator.
(See the [[The tree log files][tutorial section]] for an example of using TreeAnnotator to
summarize typed node trees.)

Note that the most sophisticated use of these trees is in answering
questions about the timing and type of events on the tree.  For
instance, one can ask, "When did the first migration on the tree
occur?"  To answer such a question, one could load the full
.typed.trees file into R (using, for instance, the treeio package),
then compute this time for every tree. This would yield a set of
samples from the posterior distribution for this time, which could
then be characterised.

** Multi-type trajectories
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Sampling-Latent-Variables-Multi-type-trajectories
:END:

Multi-type trajectories are sampled using a phylogenetic particle
filtering algorithm based on the method described by
[[https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msz106][Vaughan et al., 2019]].  For a given sampled tree and set of model
parameters, this algorithm simulates an ensemble of possible
histories, members of which are weighted by their agreement with the
tree and parameters. One particular history is then sampled from this
weighted distribution.  By applying this process to a subsample of the
states visited by the MCMC chain, we are left with a set of
trajectories drawn from the posterior distribution of the population
history, given the genetic data.

Because the output files can be rather large, trajectory sampling
is disabled by default.  Like the stochast mapping algorithm, it
can be enabled by expanding the relevant logger input editor -
"trajLogger" in this case - and ensuring "Enable Logger" is checked.

[[./figures/trajectoryEnable.png]]

Once enabled, you can adjust the logging frequency by changing the
"Log Every" value.  The default is 1000, meaning a trajectory will be
sampled and recorded every 1000 steps.  This is probably too frequent,
as trajectory files are large and you probably don't need more than a
few hundred samples to characterise the posterior. Thus I suggest you
increase this value to at least "10000" for most analyses.

Further options to do with the particle filtering algorithm itself can
be found by clicking the unlableled button next to the "typedTraj.t:"
label, which brings up a dialog box as shown below:

[[./figures/trajectoryOptions.png]]

Here we can set the "N Particles" option, which determines the size of
the weighted trajectory ensemble used to sample final trajectory. The
default is 1000. Increasing this number will improve the accuracy of
the calculation, but requires more computation. Ideally, one should
always compare results generated using different trajectory ensemble
sizes in order to test for convergence.

The "Resamp Thresh" value indicates the effective size (relative to
the total number of particles) of the particle ensemble that will
trigger a resample, during the sequential monte carlo algorithm.
The default value of 0.5 is appropriate for most situations.

The "Use Tau Leaping" checkbox specifies whether to use exact
Gillespie simulation or the approximate finite time step tau-leaping
algorithm to simulate trajectories. The approximation is significantly
faster and should generally be used, but if you run into numerical
stability issues you might consider unchecking this option.

The "Min Leap Count" and "Epsilon" values affect the tau leaping
algorithm, when used.  "Min Leap Count" specifies the minimum number of
stochastic integration steps which will be used to simulate a given trajectory,
while "Epsilon" determines how conservative the algorithm should be when
selecting step sizes, with smaller values yielding shorter step sizes.
It's almost always okay to leave these parameters alone.

*** Plotting sampled trajectories
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-Multi-type-trajectories-Sampling-Latent-Variables-Plotting-sampled-trajectories
:END:

#+begin_quote
For our example here, we use the trajectory file generated by the 
analysis from the [[Setting up your first analysis][tutorial section]] with trajectory logging enabled as
above.
#+end_quote

Trajectory data generated by BDMM-Prime is stored as a simple table in
the plain text file with the extension ".traj".  The format of this
file is described in detail in [[Trajectory file format][the appendix]].

The easiest way to plot trajectories sampled using BDMM-Prime is
using the [[https://tidyverse.org][tidyverse]] suite of R packages. To install these in R (if you haven't already), simply
issue the following command from the R command line:

#+begin_src R
install.packages("tidyverse")
#+end_src

(You'll only have to do that once.) With the packages installed you'll need
make them available in your current R session by issuing the command:

#+begin_src R
library(tidyverse)
#+end_src

The first step is to load the trajectory file using the =read_tsv= command.

#+begin_src R
    traj <- read_tsv("h3n2.h3n2_2deme.traj")
#+end_src

When doing this it is a good idea to omit some of the early trajectories
to account for burn-in.  (Examining the parameter log file is one way to
get an idea of how much to remove.)
As described in the [[Trajectory file format][trajectory file format]] section, the table has several
columns, one of which is "Sample", which indicates the MCMC iteration
a particular trajectory belongs.  We can use this to remove trajectories

For example, the following removes trajectories belonging to the first 10% of
samples, assuming $10^6$ samples overall:
#+begin_src R
traj <- traj %>% filter(Sample>=100000)
#+end_src

Another column in the table is named "variable", and is used to
indicate the type of information a given row provides about the trajectory.
To plot population sizes, we are only interested in rows where the variable
has the value "N", which means that the row contains information about a population size.
Thus, we can further filter our table to include only these rows:
#+begin_src R
traj <- traj %>% filter(variable=="N")
#+end_src

To actually plot the distribution, we use the fact that each row now
contains an "age" relative to the end of the process, a "type"
indicating the type of the population, and a "value" indicating the
size of the population immediately before age.
#+begin_src R
  ggplot(traj, aes(age, value, col=factor(type), group_by=factor(Sample))) +
    geom_line(alpha=0.2) + xlim(0,10) +
    ylab("Population size")
#+end_src
Here we've chosen to simply plot all of the sampled trajectories together,
with each trajectory coloured by its type.  Note the =group_by= option, which
is used to tell ggplot that rows with the same "Sample" value belong to
the same trajectory.  The use of =factor()= is important, as without this
ggplot will treat the type and Sample indices as continuous variables rather
than integers.  The =xlim(0,10)= command is included to focus on the time
domain covered by the majority of the trajectories.

[[./analyses/trajectories.png]]

Notice that the types are indicated using an integer rather than the original label.
As described in the section on [[Start type prior probabilities][start type prior probabilities]], these integers are
simply the indices of the type names when sorted lexicographically
(generalized alphabetically). Thus in this case, 0 stands for Hong
Kong and 1 stands for New Zealand.

While plotting all of the trajectories in this way can be interesting,
it's often more useful to display precise credible intervals for the
population sizes through time, similar to the approach often used to
visualize the results of Bayesian skyline plot analyses.

To do this, we first define a vector of ages which will span the time
domain of our plot. In our case, we'll use 1001 values spread evenly between
ages 0 and 10:

#+begin_src R
  ages <- seq(0,10,length.out=1001)
#+end_src

Then, we need to determine the population size in each trajectory at
every one of these ages.  We can do this by making use of the
=approx()= function, which is a base R procedure for interpolating
function sampled at discrete time points.
#+begin_src R
  gridded_traj <- traj %>%
    group_by(Sample, type) %>%
    reframe(N=approx(age, value, ages, method="constant", f=0, yright=0)$y,
            age=ages)
#+end_src
We can then summarize the distribution at each time point by computing
the 50%, 2.5%, and 97.5% quantiles, corresponding respectively to the median
and the lower and upper bounds of the 95% central posterior density (CPD).
#+begin_src R
  gridded_traj <- gridded_traj %>%
    group_by(type,age) %>%
    summarize(low=quantile(N,0.025),
              high=quantile(N,0.975),
              med=quantile(N,0.5))
#+end_src
These values can be nicely plotted using =geom_ribbon()= to display the CPD boundaries
and a =geom_line()= to display the medians.
#+begin_src R
  ggplot(gridded_traj,
         aes(age, N, col=factor(type), fill=factor(type), y=med, ymin=low, ymax=high)) +
      geom_ribbon(alpha=0.5) +
    geom_line() +
    ylab("Population size")
#+end_src
This yields the following graphic:

[[./analyses/trajectories_CI.png]]

This can be further improved by including actual calendar times on the time axis.
To do this we use our knowledge that the final included sample is from September 1, 2005,
meaning that this is the date relative to which our ages are computed.  (Our ages
are the number of years prior to this date.)
#+begin_src R
  ggplot(gridded_traj %>%
         mutate(Date=ymd("2005/09/01")-age*365) %>%
         mutate(Location=recode(factor(type),
                           "0"="Hong Kong",
                           "1"="New Zealand")),
         aes(date, N, col=Location, fill=Location, y=med, ymin=low, ymax=high)) +
      geom_ribbon(alpha=0.5) +
      geom_line() + ylab("Population size") +
      scale_x_date(date_breaks="1 year", date_labels="%Y")
#+end_src

[[./analyses/trajectories_CI_years.png]]

As an aside, you may have noticed that the population sizes inferred
in these example analyses are extremely small, given that these are
intended to reflect global Influenza H3N2 dynamics with sampled sequences
drawn from different countries across several years.  Recall however
that both $R_e$ and the become uninfectious rate $\delta$ were assumed
constant in the tutorial.  By fitting such a simple constant-rate
birth-death model to this dataset, our parameters are forced to
represent "effective" rates and "effective" population sizes which
best fit the birth-death dynamics on this scale.

While these effects are made very obvious by the population trajectory
posteriors, /they are no less present when performing birth-death
analyses without trajectory sampling/. It is therefore always important to
keep the possibility of these kinds of model-fitting effects in mind when
interpreting birth-death results and phylodynamic inference
results in general, even when applied at smaller scales.

While the BDMM-Prime BEAUti interface is quite flexible, there are vastly more
possibilities for model configurations than those which are accessible via
the graphical interface.  In this section we detail the important aspects of
the BEAST 2 XML model description language as it pertains to BDMM-Prime.

*** Model definition

:CUSTOM_ID: id-3-XML-reference-Appendices-Model-definition
:END:

**** The Birth-Death-Migration Distribution

The principle object contained in every BDMM-Prime analysis is the
=bdmmprime.distribution.BirthDeathMigrationDistribution= object representing
the probability of a tree under some birth-death distribution.

In the XML the element defining this object usually appears as the
value of a =distribution= input to a higher leverl
=CompoundDistribution= object in the following form:
#+begin_src xml
  <distribution spec="bdmmprime.distribution.BirthDeathMigrationDistribution">
    <!-- Inputs -->
  </distribution>
#+end_src

The main inputs defined for the =BirthDeathMigrationDistribution= are
as follows:

- =parameterization= (=Parameterization=, required) ::
  This input expects an object of the abstract type =Parameterization= to
  specify the birth-death model parameters. Existing =Parameterization= objects
  are given in the next section.
- =startTypePriorProbs= (=Function=, required for multiple types) :: This is a object
  of type =Function=/=RealParameter= whose dimension is the number of types and
  whose values represent the prior probability for the type of the initial
  individual in the process belonging to each possible type.
- =typeTraitSet= (=TraitSet=) :: This is a =TraitSet= specifying the type associated with
  each Taxon.
- =typeLabel= (=String=) :: If provided, this is a =String= specifying the node metadata key
  from which the type information should be read.
- =conditionOnSurvival= (=Boolean=, default true) :: This indicates
  whether the tree prior should be conditioned on the presence of at
  least one sample.
- =conditionOnRoot= (=Boolean=, default false) ::  This indicates
  whether the tree prior should be condigioned on the time and presence of the
  root event.  **Note:** If enabled, all =processLength= inputs must also be
  provided with the tree instead of an origin parameter.
- =finalSampleOffset= (=Function=, default 0) :: If provided, this determines
  the time between the final sample and the end of the birth-death-sampling process.
  This input is important if you want the model to be able to include the absence of samples in this
  period as information for inferring the various rates.  It is also important when
  jointly estimating tip dates.  (See the tip date operators described in the
  operator section below.)


Besides these, the following inputs are also defined.  These are primarilly used
for debugging and/or tuning the calculation performance:
  
- =useAnalyticalSingleTypeSolution= (=Boolean=, default true) :: This
  indicates whether to use the fast analytical solution for the tree prior in the case
  of single-type analyses.  Ideally this should always be left on.
- =relTolerance= (=Double=, default 1e-7) :: Relative tolerance for
  numerical integration algorithm.
- =absTolerance= (=Double=, default 1e-100) :: Absolute tolerance for
  numerical integration algorithm.
- =parallelize= (=Boolean=, default true) :: Indicates whether to
  spawn threads to parallelize the calculation of subtree likelihoods.
- =parallelizationFactor= (=Double=, default 0.1) :: The minimum
  relative size (number of nodes) the smallest of a pair of subtrees
  must have in order for their calculations to be carried out in
  separate threads.
- =savePartialLikelihoodsTofile= (=String=) :: If provided, the name
  of a file to which a tree annotated with partial likelihoods will be
  written.  This is useful for debugging the cause of chain
  initialization failures.

**** Parameterizations

The =Parameterization= is an abstract class of objects tasked with connecting parameter
values to the internal representation of birth-death models used by =BirthDeathMigrationModel=.
There are several concrete classes of this type, as detailed below.

*Note*: Besides the parameterization-specific inputs, each parameterization object takes
the following inputs:
- =processLength= (=Function= or =Tree=, required) ::
  This should be the duration of the process, either from the origin
  or from the tree root, depending on whether =conditionOnRoot= is set
  to true.  If the former, suppling an "origin" parameter is usual.
  If the latter, the tree object itself should be supplied.
- =typeSet= (=TypeSet=) :: 
  A =TypeSet= defining the types present in the model.

***** CanonincalParameterization
#+begin_src xml
  <parameterization spec="bdmmprime.parameterization.CanonicalParameterization">
  <!-- Inputs -->
  </parameterization>
#+end_src

The =CanonicalParameterization= parameterization type defines a parameterization
in terms of the basic rates for birth, death, sampling and migration events.  These
are defined by the following inputs:

- =birthRate= (=SkylineVectorParameter=, required) :: The birth rate skyline.
- =deathRate= (=SkylineVectorParameter=, required) :: The death rate skyline.
- =samplingRate= (=SkylineVectorParameter=, required) :: The sampling rate skyline.
- =removalProb= (=SkylineVectorParameter=, required) ::
  A skyline parameter representing the probability of removal on sampling.
- =rhoSampling= (=TimedParameter=) ::
  Specifies the times and probabilities of contemporaneous sampling events.
- =migrationRate= (=SkylineMatrixParameter=) ::
  The migration rate matrix skyline.
- =birthRateAmongDemes= (=SkylineMatrixParameter=) :: 
  The rate matrix skyline describing the rates of births producing
  children with types differing from the parent.

***** EpiParameterization
#+begin_src xml
  <parameterization spec="bdmmprime.parameterization.EpiParameterization">
  <!-- Inputs -->
  </parameterization>
#+end_src

This defines a parameterization in terms of rates useful for
epidemiological applications:

- =Re= (=SkylineVectgorParameter=, required) :: The effective reproduction number skyline.
- =becomeUninfectiousRate= (=SkylineVectgorParameter=, required) :: The become uninfectious rate skyline.
- =samplingProportion= (=SkylineVectgorParameter=, required) :: The sampling proportion skyline.
- =removalProb= (=SkylineVectorParameter=, required) ::
  A skyline parameter representing the probability of removal on sampling.
- =rhoSampling= (=TimedParameter=) ::
  Specifies the times and probabilities of contemporaneous sampling events.
- =migrationRate= (=SkylineMatrixParameter=) ::
  The migration rate matrix skyline.
- =ReAmongDemes= (=SkylineMatrixParameter=) :: 
  A matrix skyline representing a generalized effective reproduction
  number indicating parameterizing the average number of birth events

***** FBDParameterization
#+begin_src xml
  <parameterization spec="bdmmprime.parameterization.FBDParameterization">
  <!-- Inputs -->
  </parameterization>
#+end_src

This defines a parameterization in terms of rates useful for macroevolutionary
applications. It uses the [[https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319091111][Fossilized Birth-Death process (Heath et al., 2014)]]
parameterization.

- =diversificationRate= (=SkylineVectgorParameter=, required) ::
  The diversification rate (difference of speciation and extinction rates) skyline.
- =turnover= (=SkylineVectgorParameter=, required) ::
  The turnover (ratio of extinction rate to birth rate) skyline.
- =samplingProportion= (=SkylineVectgorParameter=, required) ::
  The sampling proportion skyline.
- =removalProb= (=SkylineVectorParameter=, required) ::
  A skyline parameter representing the probability of removal on sampling.
- =rhoSampling= (=TimedParameter=) ::
  Specifies the times and probabilities of contemporaneous sampling events.
- =migrationRate= (=SkylineMatrixParameter=) ::
  The migration rate matrix skyline.
- =diversificationRateAmongDemes= (=SkylineMatrixParameter=) :: 
  A matrix skyline representing the difference between the speciation rate
  into a new compartment and the extinction rate in that same compartment.

*Warning*: The FBD parameterization as usually set up in BDMM-Prime
produces MCMC chains that do not cross the $\lambda=\mu$
boundary. That is, one always has either $\lambda>\mu$ (positive
diversification rate) or $\lambda<\mu$ (negative diversification
rate), as determined by the initial parameter values.  The reason for
this is that proposing a sign change in the diversification rate
requires a coincident inversion of the turnover, which is unsupported
by the default operators.  Thus, if you don't want to make this strong
/a priori/ assumption about the sign of the diversification rate, it's
best to use the =CanonicalParameterization= instead.


**** Skyline parameters

For the most part, parameters supplied to the parameterizations listed above
are "skyline parameters", which define matrix- or vector-valued piecewise
constant functions of time, where the vector values associate rates
with specific types, and the matrix values associate rates with
specific type pairs. Additionally, the =rhoSampling= input requires
a =TimedParameter= which specifies a vector of values together with a set of
individual times associated with these values.

The followinc sections describ the complete set of inputs to each of
these types.

***** SkylineVectorParameter

#+begin_src xml
  <parameter spec="bdmm.prime.parameterization.SkylineVectorParameter">
  <!-- Inputs -->
  </parameter>
#+end_src

The skyline vector parameter specifies a piecewise-constant function
with, in general, type-specific values. It takes the following inputs:

- =skylineValues= (=Function=, required) ::
- =changeTimes= (=Function=) ::
  Each of this pair of inputs takes a =Function= (such as a =RealParameter=).
  Together they specify the change times and epoch values of the skyline
  parameter, and how these values are distributed across types.
  specifies the values associated with the piecewise-constant function.
  The dimension $N$ of the skylineValues =Function= or =RealParameter=, in combination with the
  dimension $K$ of the changeTimes =Function= or =RealParameter= (0 if this input is not set),
  determine how these values are distributed among types and times.

  Defining $D$ to be the number of distinct types in the model, there are two main
  possibilities. Firstly, if $N=K+1$ (i.e. the number of epochs
  implied by =changeTimes=), the elements $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_N$ are
  assumed to apply uniformly to all types in each epoch.  That is:
  |-------+--------+-------+--------|
  | Epoch | Type 0 | Type1 | Type 2 |
  |-------+--------+-------+--------|
  |     0 | v1     | v1    | v1     |
  |     1 | v2     | v2    | v2     |
  |     2 | v3     | v3    | v3     |
  |   ... | ...    | ...   | ...    |
  Alternatively, if $N=(K+1)\times D$,
  the first $D$ skylineValues elements represent the values associated with types in the first epoch,
  the next $D$ represent the values for types in the second epoch, and so on:
  |-------+--------+--------+--------|
  | Epoch | Type 0 | Type 1 | Type 2 |
  |-------+--------+--------+--------|
  |     0 | v1     | v2     | v3     |
  |     1 | v4     | v5     | v6     |
  |     2 | v7     | v8     | v9     |
  |   ... | ...    | ...    | ...    |
- typeSet (=TypeSet=) :: 
  A reference to the =TypeSet= for the model. While optional, it's
  worthwhile supplying this input if multiple types are in play to
  allow for additional checking and more easily-interpretable logging.
- timesAreAges (=Boolean=, default false) :: 
  When set to true, this input causes the change times supplied to =changeTimes= to be
  interpreted as ages relative to the end of the birth-death
  process. (I.e. the time of the final sample + the value of
  =finalSampleOffset=.)  This also affects the ordering of the
  assignment to epochs. (E.g. value $v_1$ will be associated with the most recent epoch
  when =timesAreAges= is true, but the oldest epoch when it is false.)
- timesAreRelative (=Boolean=, default false) :: 
  When set to true, times or ages are treated as relative fractions of the process length.
- processLength (=Function=) ::
  This is the object specifying the process length.  It is only
  necessary when one or both of =timesAreAges= and =timesAreRelative=
  are set to true.

***** SkylineMatrixParameter

#+begin_src xml
  <parameter spec="bdmm.prime.parameterization.SkylineMatrixParameter">
  <!-- Inputs -->
  </parameter>
#+end_src

The skyline matrix parameter specifies a piecewise-constant function
with, in general, type pair-specific values. It takes the following inputs:

- =skylineValues= (=Function=, required) ::
- =changeTimes= (=Function=) ::
  Just as for =SkylineVectorParameter=, 
  each of this pair of inputs takes a =Function= (such as a =RealParameter=).
  Together they specify the change times and epoch values of the skyline
  matrix parameter, and how these values are distributed across source/destination type pairs.
  The dimension $N$ of the skylineValues =Function= or =RealParameter=, in combination with the
  dimension $K$ of the changeTimes =Function= or =RealParameter= (0 if this input is not set),
  determine how these values are distributed among types and times.

  Defining $D$ to be the number of distinct types in the model, there are two main
  possibilities. Firstly, if $N=K+1$ (i.e. the number of epochs
  implied by =changeTimes=), the elements $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_N$ are
  assumed to apply uniformly to all types pairs in each epoch.  That is:
  #+ATTR_HTML: :class skylineMatrix

  |   ... | ...         | ...       | ...      |           |
  Alternatively, if $N=(K+1)\times D(D-1)$,
  the first $D(D-1)$ skylineValues elements represent the values associated with type pairs in the first epoch,
  the next $D(D-1)$ represent the values for types in the second epoch, and so on:
  #+ATTR_HTML: :class skylineMatrix

  are set to true.


***** TimedParameter

#+begin_src xml
  <parameter spec="bdmm.prime.parameterization.TimedParameter">
  <!-- Inputs -->
  </parameter>
#+end_src

The timed parameter specifies an, in general, type-dependent sequence
of values associated with one or more times. It is used to define the
timing and probabilities for "rho sampling" events. These are the possible inputs:

- =values= (=Function=) ::
- =times= (=Function=) ::
  Each of this pair of inputs takes a =Function= (such as a =RealParameter=).
  Together they specify the timing and sampling probabilities associated with
  0 or more rho sampling events.
  The dimension $N$ of the values =Function= or =RealParameter=, in combination with the
  dimension $K$ of the times  =Function= or =RealParameter=,
  determine how the probabilities provided are distributed among types and times.

  Defining $D$ to be the number of distinct types in the model, there are two main
  possibilities. Firstly, if $N=K$ (i.e. the number of events
  implied by =times=), the elements $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_N$ are
  assumed to apply uniformly to all types at each event.  That is:
  |-------+--------+-------+--------|
  | Event | Type 0 | Type1 | Type 2 |
  |-------+--------+-------+--------|
  |     0 | v1     | v1    | v1     |
  |     1 | v2     | v2    | v2     |
  |     2 | v3     | v3    | v3     |
  |   ... | ...    | ...   | ...    |
  Alternatively, if $N=K\times D$,
  the first $D$ elements represent the values associated with types for the first event,
  the next $D$ represent the values for types for the second event, and so on:
  |-------+--------+--------+--------|
  | Event | Type 0 | Type 1 | Type 2 |
  |-------+--------+--------+--------|
  |     0 | v1     | v2     | v3     |
  |     1 | v4     | v5     | v6     |
  |     2 | v7     | v8     | v9     |
  |   ... | ...    | ...    | ...    |
- typeSet (=TypeSet=) :: 
  A reference to the =TypeSet= for the model. While optional, it's
  worthwhile supplying this input if multiple types are in play to
  allow for additional checking and more easily-interpretable logging.
- timesAreAges (=Boolean=, default false) :: 
  When set to true, this input causes the change times supplied to =changeTimes= to be
  interpreted as ages relative to the end of the birth-death
  process. (I.e. the time of the final sample + the value of
  =finalSampleOffset=.)  This also affects the ordering of the
  assignment to epochs. (E.g. value $v_1$ will be associated with the most recent epoch
  when =timesAreAges= is true, but the oldest epoch when it is false.)
- timesAreRelative (=Boolean=, default false) :: 
  When set to true, times or ages are treated as relative fractions of the process length.

  This is the object specifying the process length.  It is only

  are set to true.

** Trajectory file format
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: id-2-Appendices-Trajectory-file-format
:END:

Trajectory files are tab-separated variable (TSV) files containing a
table with 7 columns and a large number of rows.  The first row is
a header row.  The file can be read into R using the =readr::read_tsv=
function.

The following is the start of a table generated by enabling trajectory
sampling in the H3N2 example used in the tutorial:

|--------+--------+------+----------+------+-------+-------|
| Sample |      t |  age | variable | type | type2 | value |
|--------+--------+------+----------+------+-------+-------|
|  10000 |      0 | 8.67 | N        |    0 | NA    |     1 |
|  10000 |      0 | 8.67 | N        |    1 | NA    |     0 |
|  10000 |      0 | 8.67 | O        |   NA | NA    |    NA |
|  10000 | 0.0865 | 8.58 | N        |    0 | NA    |     2 |
|  10000 | 0.0865 | 8.58 | N        |    1 | NA    |     0 |
|  10000 | 0.0865 | 8.58 | B        |    0 | 0     |     1 |
|    ... |    ... |  ... | ...      |  ... | ...   |   ... |

The sample column on the left indicates the MCMC iteration the
trajectory belongs to.  (All rows with the same sample number
correspond to the same MCMC iteration, i.e. the same population
trajectory.) Each row reports either a population size or an event
at a particular time, as indicated by the entry in the "variable"
column.

Population sizes are reported by rows with the "variable" column
set to "N".  Each such row reports the population size associated
with the type index given in the "type" column and the size
in the "value" column. The size corresponds to the time immediately
at and after the time given in the "t" column. (Respectively, the immedately
before the age given in the "age" column.)

Events are reported by rows with the following characters in the
"variable" column:
- B ::
  This indicates that the event at the given time/age was a birth event.
  The type column indicates the type of the individual that gave birth.
  The child type is given by the value in type2. 
- D :: 
  This indicates that the event at the given time/age was a death event.
  The type column indicates the type of the individual that died.
  The value of type2 is always NA in this case.
- S :: 
  This indicates that the event at the given time/age was a sampling event.
  The type column indicates the type of the sampled individual.
  The value of type2 is always NA in this case.
- M :: 
  This indicates that the event at the given time/age was a migration event.
  The type column indicates the original type of the migrating individual.
  The value of type2 is the destination type.
- O :: 
  This is a dummy event that indicates the start of the stochastic process.
  The type and value columns for this event are meaningless. There should be
  exactly one such event per trajectory.

For events, the "value" column indicates the multiplicity of the
event. I.e., how many times it occurred.  (The approximate tau leaping
simulation algorithm allows more than one event to occur in a single
simulation step.)
